If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy?

There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich.

And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous.

What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life?

We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life.

And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men.

And I'm the fourth director of the study.

Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.

When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed.

They were given medical exams.

And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life.

The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues.

Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."

And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's about time."

What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives?

The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.

And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.

And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.

High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.

And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.

The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.

And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.

But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time?

And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.

What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
